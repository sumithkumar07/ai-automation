# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# APP ANALYSIS COMPLETED ✅

## GOAL OF THE APP: **Aether Automation - AI-Powered Workflow Platform**
The app is a next-generation workflow automation platform similar to Zapier, Make.com, or Microsoft Power Automate. The primary goals are:
- **Workflow Automation**: Allow users to create automated workflows connecting different apps and services
- **AI-Enhanced**: Features AI-powered workflow generation, optimization, and intelligent decision making  
- **Enterprise Ready**: Supports team collaboration, advanced security, and scalability
- **200+ Integrations**: Connect to various apps and services
- **User-Friendly**: Drag-and-drop workflow builder with beautiful UI

## WHAT HAS BEEN BUILT SO FAR:

### BACKEND (FastAPI + MongoDB): ✅ WORKING
- **Basic API Server**: FastAPI server running on port 8001 with CORS enabled
- **Database**: MongoDB connection configured and working 
- **Basic Endpoints**: `/api/` endpoint returning {"message": "Hello World"}
- **Status Check API**: CRUD operations for status checks
- **Advanced Features Documented**: Comprehensive documentation claims 11-phase enhancement system with AI capabilities, but core implementation appears to be foundational

### FRONTEND (React + Tailwind): ✅ WORKING
- **Modern React App**: React 19 with React Router v7, successfully loading
- **Beautiful Homepage**: Professional landing page with "Aether Automation" branding
- **Navigation**: Header with "Sign In" and "Get Started Free" links
- **Hero Section**: "Automate Everything" with compelling description
- **Statistics**: Impressive stats (10K+ users, 50K+ workflows, 100K+ hours saved, 100+ integrations)
- **Call-to-Actions**: "Start Building Free" and "Watch Demo" buttons
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS with mobile responsiveness
- **Authentication System**: AuthContext and routing for protected/public pages

### FIXED ISSUES DURING SETUP: ✅ RESOLVED
1. **Missing Dependencies**: Added react-hot-toast, @heroicons/react, recharts, @headlessui/react
2. **Environment Variable Mismatch**: Fixed Vite syntax (import.meta.env) to CRA syntax (process.env)
3. **Entry Point Confusion**: Resolved dual App.js/App.jsx conflict, now using correct App.jsx
4. **API Configuration**: Fixed baseURL to use process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
5. **Lazy Loading Issues**: Temporarily disabled lazy loading for Homepage to resolve loading issues

### CURRENT STATUS: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Backend**: Running and responding to API calls
- **Frontend**: Beautiful homepage loads perfectly with all content
- **Services**: All supervisor services (frontend, backend, mongodb) running
- **Environment**: Properly configured with correct URLs and ports

## NEXT STEPS NEEDED:
The foundational platform is solid and the UI is impressive. The main gap appears to be the core workflow automation functionality. The app needs:
1. **Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop workflow creation interface
2. **Integration System**: Actual implementations of the 200+ claimed integrations
3. **AI Features**: Implementation of the AI-powered workflow generation
4. **User Authentication**: Complete registration/login flow
5. **Dashboard**: User dashboard for managing workflows
6. **Workflow Execution Engine**: Backend system to run workflows
